### If Statements

**If statements** are like traffic intersections in your code. They allow you to have different paths the program can take depending on what happens as it is executed. Different pieces of code get executed depending on what the user submits, a computation's result, or a value that gets returned somewhere else in the program. Each path is called a branch, and **control flow** describes the use of branches within our code.
