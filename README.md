## If Statements

These handy fellas let us control the flow of our programs. This flow let's us trigger events to happen based on specific input. So what does this mean? Less manual control. WOO.

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1 Explain what an if statement is and why itâ€™s used
2 Implement an if state with 1, 2, and 3+ branches
3 Implement the comparison operators
